I've been a developer for almost 3 years. I worked mainly with Angular, React Native, C# .NET, SqlServer and PostgreSql.

- ðŸŒ± Currently trying to learn Rust little by little, since it's a very different programming language than what I normally use. It helps me to be more willing to see personal projects as hobbies and not extensions of my daily work.
- ðŸ’» Working with Angular (Typescript), Html, Css, C#.Net;
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him;
- âœ¨ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of Digimon, Fighting Games and drawing. I also like linux, emulatio and the idea of conserving old games and it's stories.
